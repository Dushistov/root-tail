OPINION

   In my opinion, this program is a pile of crap which gets crappier with
   every patch, but it is also sooo useful ;*)

MAINTAINER

   This program has gone through many hands (and is maybe the
   most-forked-program ever), the current self-appointed maintainer, who
   never wanted to publish his version is:

   Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>, http://root-tail.plan9.de/

   Please send him any patches for this version.
